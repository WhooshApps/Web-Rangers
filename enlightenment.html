We quote fresh from wikipedia:
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_security">
    Internet security is a branch of computer security specifically related to the Internet, often involving browser security but also network security on a more general level as it applies to other applications or operating systems on a whole. Its objective is to establish rules and measures to use against attacks over the Internet.The Internet represents an insecure channel for exchanging information leading to a high risk of intrusion or fraud, such as phishing.Different methods have been used to protect the transfer of data, including encryption and from-the-ground-up engineering.

    <h1>Internet phising</h1>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">
    Phishing is the attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and, indirectly, money), often for malicious reasons, by disguising as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.

    <h1>Anti-Phishing</h1>
    <br>
    <strong><q style="text-align:center;">Phishing is a major problem because there really is no patch for human stupidity</q></strong><br><br>
    The sole idea behind the project is to make the user aware about various methods adopted by phishers.
    Thus some of these methods are as listed below:
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Spear phishing</h3>
               Phishing attempts directed at specific individuals or companies have been termed spear phishing.
        </li>
        <li><h3>Clone phishing</h3>
            Clone phishing is a type of phishing attack whereby a legitimate, and previously delivered, email containing an attachment or link has had its content and recipient address(es) taken and used to create an almost identical or cloned email.
        </li>
        <li><h3>Link manipulation</h3>
            Common trick is to make the displayed text for a link (the text between the <A> tags) suggest a reliable destination, when the link actually goes to the phishers' site.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Below are some precautions that 'can' help you to prevent from falling for a scam.
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Anti-phishing softwares</h3>
            Anti-phishing software consists of computer programs that attempt to identify phishing content contained in websites and e-mail or block users from being tricked. It is often integrated with web browsers and email clients.
        <li><h3>Secure connection</h3>
            Search for EV certificates because it replaces certain certificates providing a high level of organization identity verification with a green display, and other certificates with an extended blue favicon box to the left of the URL bar (in addition to the switch from "http" to "https" in the url itself).<br>Example-<img src="img/EV.png" >   
        </li>
        <li><h3>Common sense</h3>
             It has been scientifically proven that using common sense has never harmed anyone nevertheless it has been beneficiary to some.

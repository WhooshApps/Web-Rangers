We quote fresh from wikipedia:
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_security">
    Internet security is a branch of computer security specifically related to the Internet, often involving browser security but also network security on a more general level as it applies to other applications or operating systems on a whole. Its objective is to establish rules and measures to use against attacks over the Internet.The Internet represents an insecure channel for exchanging information leading to a high risk of intrusion or fraud, such as phishing.Different methods have been used to protect the transfer of data, including encryption and from-the-ground-up engineering.
